In the diagram plot four curves (one for each polynomial degree). The horizontal axis (C) should be log-scaled.\n","* **Step 4.** Plot four diagrams, in each showing the data points as well as the decision thresholds for one of the four polynomial degrees when its best C value is used. If you know how to plot a heatmap, you may also plot a heatmap with Degree vs. C axes. A heatmap sometimes can be more informative.\n","\n","**Task 2**\n","* Write conclusions about the plotted diagrams, especially the F1 vs. C diagram, and printed F1 and Accuracy values.
