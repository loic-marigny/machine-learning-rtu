Create a total of eight polynomials from degree 1 to 8. Compute and print training MSE and validation MSE values for each of them. Validation MSE should be computed using LOOCV (use the function that we already created). Draw a plot with two curves analogous to the plot shown in slide 9 from today's lecture. Add a legend so that it is clear which curve is which.\n","2. Repeat Task 1 with a modified LOOCV function so that it does not use anything from scikit-learn anymore - instead it should use only numpy. You should get the same result as in Task 1.\n","3. Explain the plot from Task 1. What exactly do we see in it and what conclusions can we make from it?\n","4.
