When you run it, it should have exactly the same number of iterations as SFS. Verify its correctness by checking if it returns the overall best coefficient of determination as `0.8646172504920925`.\n","\n","**Task 2**<br>\n","Modify your code further to create a plot from the SBS iteration results, where X axis is the number of selected features and the Y axis is the best MSE of that iteration. Write a short analysis of the plot (what can you conclude from it?).\n","\n","**Task 3**<br>\n","Replace the Linear Regression model with KNN model (with k = 5) and run SFS and SBS with it. Look at the returned MSE and R2 values and the new plot. Compare the results to those of Linear Regression and write a short analysis of the returned values and plots, highlighting the main aspects. (Note that your notebook should now have two plots - one from Linear Regression (Task 2) and one from KNN (Task 3).)"],"metadata":{"id":"RfiA55N_R6wZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# write your code here"],"metadata":{"id":"c_dfzPVlCfuy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","**After the tasks are done, submit this file.
