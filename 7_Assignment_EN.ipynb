And what if the email contains the word \"click\" 20 times? Explain the results."],"metadata":{"id":"npgtHxcnZKX3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["*write your answer here*"],"metadata":{"id":"3-kFl34KZRxo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Question 2\n","Now try the same with our own implementation given in the last cell of the notebook.
